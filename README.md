# Audijo

**It is in beta!**
Help me test this badboi, I can't really test all edge cases since I myself only have 2 ASIO devices. So if you find any bugs or crashes lemme know. ASIO should function right now, next up is WASAPI.

Simply an up to date audio library with actual documentation and full ASIO/WASAPI support.
